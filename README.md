Natural Language Processing to find Email spam

In this project, Natural Language Processing was performed on Kaggle dataset. It consists of two rows , <text, spam>.

We first trained the dataset on existing value(whether it is spam or not) using Naive Bayes and then applied on training 
dataset. 

There was very little deviation from actual result.
